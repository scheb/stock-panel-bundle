========================

**DEPRECATED**

Consider using this ready-to-use application: https://github.com/scheb/stock-panel

---

I've written this Symfony2 bundle for myself to keep track of my stock portfolio. It uses my [Yahoo Finance API](https://github.com/scheb/yahoo-finance-api) to fetch current quotes and calculates profit and loss from it.
